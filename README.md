This repository provides implementations of several state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers for mango leaf disease classification. 
The models include Vision Transformer (ViT), VGG16, ResNet (50 and 101), AlexNet, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Large, MobileNet, and DenseNet161, all initialized 
with pretrained weights and fine-tuned for the task. The classifiers are trained and evaluated on three types of datasets: the real mango leaf disease dataset, 
a GAN-based augmented dataset, and a diffusion-based dataset. In addition, 
the study explores the impact of color space transformations (HSV, Lab, and YCbCr) on model performance, 
providing a comprehensive analysis of how different representations and data generation techniques influence classification accuracy.


These classifier codes are proposed as part of the research work titled “LeafDiffusion: Advancing Mango Leaf Disease Recognition with Latent Diffusion Models and Multi-Color Space Analysis”, published in the journal The Visual Computer. They represent the result of extensive research and development efforts. If you use or build upon this work, please cite this repository. Proper acknowledgment not only gives credit to the contributors but also supports reproducibility, transparency, and ongoing progress in research.
