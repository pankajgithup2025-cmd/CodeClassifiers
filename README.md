This repository provides implementations of several state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers for mango leaf disease classification. 
The models include Vision Transformer (ViT), VGG16, ResNet (50 and 101), AlexNet, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Large, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet161, all initialized 
with pretrained weights and fine-tuned for the task. The classifiers are trained and evaluated on three types of datasets: the real mango leaf disease dataset, 
a GAN-based augmented dataset, and a diffusion-based dataset. In addition, 
the study explores the impact of color space transformations (HSV, Lab, and YCbCr) on model performance, 
providing a comprehensive analysis of how different representations and data generation techniques influence classification accuracy.
